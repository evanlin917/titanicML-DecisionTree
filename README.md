# titanicML-DecisionTree
A decision tree machine learning classification model created based off SoloLearn's Machine Learning curriculum and the Titanic data sets sourced from Kaggle.
The Python packages used in this project include NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
The NumPy package is used to create arrays of data values and features a whole array of arithmetic operations and functions to perform on such data.
The pandas package allows for the cleaning and organization of data into DataFrame structures and series.
Matplotlib is a package that allows for visualization of the data sorted in pandas through a variety of different plot and graph structures.
Scikit-learn is a package that allows for the performance of machine learning models on the data.
In this project, the model chosen was the Decision Tree model.
Learning was supervised learning based off Kaggle's titanic_train.csv data set.
The same project was replicated on Google Colaboratory, with the code attached.
